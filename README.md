# 🧠 C++ Object-Oriented & STL Practice

This project demonstrates my understanding of **core C++ programming concepts**, including classes, constructors/destructors, memory management, and the **Standard Template Library (STL)**.  
It’s a personal practice project I built while mastering modern C++ fundamentals.

---

## 🚀 Overview
I developed several short programs and study snippets to deepen my understanding of:
- Object-oriented design
- Copying and destroying objects safely
- Managing dynamic memory
- Using STL containers and algorithms effectively

## 🧩 Core Concepts Demonstrated

### ⚙️ Object-Oriented Programming
- Defining and organizing **classes**
- Creating **accessors**, **mutators**, and helper functions
- Implementing **constructors** and **destructors**
- Handling **copy constructors** and **copy assignment operators**
- Using the `this` pointer and scope control

### 📚 Standard Template Library (STL)
- Working with `vector`, `map`, and `list`
- Iterating through containers with `begin()` and `end()`
- Using algorithms like `sort()`, `find()`, and `copy()`
- Understanding **iterators** and how they bridge containers and algorithms
- Combining custom functions with STL sorting and searching

### 🧮 General C++ Skills
- Input/output (`cin`, `cout`, `getline`)
- Array and pointer operations
- Clean program structure with modular design

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Language:** C++  
- **Compiler:** g++  
- **Editor:** VS Code 
- **Environment:** Local & UNIX-based testing setup  

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
Through this project I strengthened my ability to:
- Translate logic into **structured, maintainable C++ code**
- Debug and optimize algorithms
- Write reusable and readable code using modern C++ conventions


---

## 📸 Future Improvements
- Add advanced examples with **inheritance** and **polymorphism**  
- Explore **file I/O** and **exception handling**  
- Integrate **unit testing** for class functions
